# News Site

The assignment was to build a classic news site, focusing on responsiveness through use of flexbox.

## The problem

I used the responsive design of the Noops Clone tutorial as a skeleton for a Mobile First approach using flexbox. I focused on responsiveness first, going as far as attempting to make the website look at least okay in any size, not just on the most common devices. To aid in this, I used the CSS attribute object-fit, setting it to "cover", giving dynamic scaling to my images. I'm quite happy with the results achieved in this respect. During development, I used high-contrast background colors for the different CSS selectors to more easily see the flexbox and box model behaviour. I moved on to visual design only when I knew I had a working responsive layout. Other than that, I had very little in terms of planning, which is something to improve for next week.

I used a simple JavaScript script found online to change Elmo's expression on hover over his image. I designed the website logo using the free vector drawing program Inkscape. All images on the site were drawn using Krita at an earlier time.

If I had more time, I would:
    create subpages for each article
    make the nav bar offer a dropdown menu and be functional
    make the hamburger icon offer an expandable menu and be functional
    add a fade-out effect to the article preview text, instead of just cutting it clean off
    add more fun hover effects to the images
    add proper alternative text for images to increase accessability
    find a more fun headline font using Google Fonts
